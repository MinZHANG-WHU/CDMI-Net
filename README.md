# CDMI-Net

This repository contains code, network definitions and pre-trained models for a novel deep neural network (CDMI-Net). The CDMI-Net that combines change detection and multiple instance learning (MIL) is proposed for landslide mapping.

The implementation uses the [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework.
